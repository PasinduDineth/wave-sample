# Developer Feedback. 
In this project, I'm thrilled to showcase a commitment to best coding practices by integrating tools such as Eslint and SonarLint. Notably, the implementation of the React-Query library has played a pivotal role, enhancing data-fetching efficiency, state management, and overall performance. The project's scalable structure, coupled with reusable components, not only ensures code quality but also significantly saves time for future developers. Additionally, the inclusion of a centralized theme file reinforces the project's adaptability.
